    "Introduction:\n",
    "In this project, I am visualizing and analyzing data from my robot's IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor. Robots are used in a variety of scenarios, and IMU data is really important. This data includes data on acceleration values, velocities, and positions, and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) data. My data generated in real-time by my robot's Adafruit 9-DOF Fusion Breakout IMU, and logged in a CSV file. My goals is to take the imu_data.csv file produced my robot, and break it down, and visualize it. This would allow me to visualize what the robot was doing after a run, and analyze it's behavior based on the data.\n",
